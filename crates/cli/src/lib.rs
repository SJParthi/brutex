//! The sweep, driven from a command line.
//!
//! # What this closes
//!
//! Until this crate existed, nothing that could be RUN reached the sweep. The
//! only binary in the workspace was `api`, and its dependency set names neither
//! [`runner`] nor anything beneath it. So the Apriori ladder, the 280-position
//! vocabulary, the exit grid, the walk-forward and the significance bar were
//! compiled, tested, benchmarked — and unreachable from any entry point. The
//! three render surfaces that display them had no caller at all.
//!
//! # Every bar this crate sweeps is GENERATED, and it says so in the output
//!
//! The operator's standing rule is that no vendor pull may originate here and
//! that the bars already on disk may not be used either. So the only honest
//! input is [`runner::synthetic`], and this crate takes no other. That is a
//! real limit, not a placeholder: **a report rendered from generated bars is
//! not a backtest**, and a reader who mistook one for the other would be making
//! exactly the error `CLAUDE.md` §4 bans a program from inviting.
//!
//! It is therefore stated in the rendered output itself, not only here — see
//! [`PROVENANCE`]. A banner in a doc comment protects nobody reading a
//! terminal.
//!
//! # What a caller must decide
//!
//! `min_hits` and the session count. Neither has a default in [`runner`],
//! because `CLAUDE.md` §3 rule 1 will not let that crate invent one, and this
//! crate does not invent one either — it requires them on the command line and
//! refuses without them. The vocabulary's own [`Widths`], [`Availability`] and
//! [`Thresholds`] are the pinned set, which is the only configuration this
//! build ships.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! This crate makes no cost claim of its own. It generates bars, hands them to
//! [`runner::Sweeper`] and renders the result; the bounds are `runner`'s and
//! `engine`'s, measured by their own benches.
